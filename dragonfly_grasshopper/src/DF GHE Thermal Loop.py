"""
Create an Ground Heat Exchanger Thermal Loop, which represents all infrastructure
for a District Energy Simulation (DES) simulation.
_
This includes a ground heat exchanger and all thermal connectors needed
to connect these objects to Dragonfly Buildings.
-

    Args:
        _ghe_geo: Horizontal Rhino surfaces representing the footprints of ground heat
            exchangers. These ground heat exchanging fields contain the
            boreholes that supply the loop with thermal capacity. Multiple
            borehole fields can be located along the loop created by the
            _connector_geo.
        _connector_geo: An array of lines or polylines representing the thermal connectors
            within the thermal loop. In order for a given connector to be valid
            within the loop, each end of the connector must touch either another
            connector, a building footprint, or a ground heat exchanger. In
            order for the loop as a whole to be valid, the connectors must form a
            single continuous loop when passed through the buildings and the heat
            exchanger field.
        _clockwise_: A boolean to note whether the direction of flow through the
            loop is clockwise (True) when viewed from above in the GeoJSON or it
            is counterclockwise (False). (Default: False).
        _bore_depth_: A number for the maximum depth of the heat-exchanging part of the
            boreholes in meters. This can also be a domain (aka interval) that
            sets the minimum and maximum depths of the boreholes (when the
            default minimum depth of 60 meters is not desirable). When the
            system demand cannot be met using boreholes with the minimum depth,
            the boreholes will be extended until either the loads or met or
            they reach the maximum depth specified here. So this typically
            represents the depth of bedrock or the point at which drilling
            deeper ceases to be practical. (Default: 135 meters).
        _bore_spacing_: A number for the minimum spacing between boreholes in meters.
            This can also be a domain (aka interval) that sets the minimum
            and maximum spacing of the boreholes (when the default maximum
            spacing of 10 meters is not desirable). When the system demand
            cannot be met using boreholes with the maximum spacing, the
            borehole spacing will be reduced until either the loads or met
            or they reach this minimum spacing. So this typically represents
            the spacing at which each borehole will interfere with neighboring
            ones so much that it is not worthwhile to decrease the spacing
            further. (Default: 3 meters).
        _soil_conduct_: A number for the soil conductivity in W/m-K. (Default: 2.3).
        _soil_heat_cap_: A number for the volumetric heat capacity of the soil
            in J/m3-K. (Default: 2,343,500).
        _fluid_type_: Text to indicate the type of fluid circulating through the
            ground heat exchanger loop. Choose from the options
            below. (Default: Water).
            _
            * Water
            * EthylAlcohol
            * EthyleneGlycol
            * MethylAlcohol
            * PropyleneGlycol
        concentration_: A number between 0 and 60 for the concentration of the
            fluid_type in water in percent. Note that this variable has no effect
            when the fluid_type is Water. (Default: 35).
        _name_: Text to be used for the name and identifier of the Thermal Loop.
            If no name is provided, it will be "unnamed".

    Returns:
        report: Reports, errors, warnings, etc.
        loop: A Dragonfly Thermal Loop object possessing all infrastructure for a
            District Energy Simulation (DES) simulation. This should be connected
            to the loop_ input of the "DF Model to GeoJSON" component.
