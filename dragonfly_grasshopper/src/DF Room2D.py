"""
Create Dragonfly Room2Ds from floor plate geometry (horizontal Rhino surfaces).
-

    Args:
        _geo: A list of horizontal Rhino surfaces representing floor plates to
            be converted into Room2Ds.
        _flr_to_ceiling: A number for the height above the floor where the
            ceiling begins. Typical values range from 3 to 5 meters.
        _name_: Text to set the base name for the Room2D, which will also be
            incorporated into unique Room2D identifier. This will be combined
            with the index of each input _footprint_geo to yield a unique name
            for each output Room2D. If the name is not provided, a random one
            will be assigned.
        _program_: Text for the program of the Room2Ds (to be looked up in the
            ProgramType library) such as that output from the "HB List Programs"
            component. This can also be a custom ProgramType object. If no program
            is input here, the Room2Ds will have a generic office program.
        _constr_set_: Text for the construction set of the Room2Ds, which is used
            to assign all default energy constructions needed to create an energy
            model. Text should refer to a ConstructionSet within the library such
            as that output from the "HB List Construction Sets" component. This
            can also be a custom ConstructionSet object. If nothing is input here,
            the Room2Ds will have a generic construction set that is not sensitive
            to the Room2Ds's climate or building energy code.
        conditioned_: Boolean to note whether the Room2Ds have heating and cooling
            systems.

    Returns:
        report: Reports, errors, warnings, etc.
        room2d: Dragonfly Room2Ds.
