"""
Rejoin a list of Room2Ds that were originally a part of a Building back to a new
Building with updated Room2Ds.
_
In the event that the input contains Room2Ds that were not a part of an original
Building, this component can still be used but the stories will be regenerated
based on the Room2D floor elevations and a warning will be given.
-

    Args:
        _room2ds: A list of Dragonfly Room2D objects to be re-joined into Buildings.

    Returns:
        report: Reports, errors, warnings, etc.
        buildings: Dragonfly Buildings containing the input Room2Ds. This may be multiple
            buildings when the input Room2Ds originally had several different
            parent buildings.
