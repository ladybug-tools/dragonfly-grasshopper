Solve adjacencies between the Room2Ds of Dragonfly objects.
-

    Args:
        _df_objs: A list of dragonfly Room2Ds for which adjacencies will be solved.
            This can also be Dragonfly Stories, Buildings or an entire Model,
            in which case each Story will have adjacencies solved across its
            Room2Ds.
        adiabatic_: Set to True to have all the discovered wall adjacencies set to
            an adiabatic boundary condition. If False, a Surface boundary
            condition will be used for all adjacencies. Note that adabatic
            conditions are not allowed if interior windows are assigned to
            interior walls. (Default: False).
        air_boundary_: Set to True to have all the discovered wall adjacencies set to
            an AirBoundary type. Note that AirBoundary types are not allowed
            if interior windows are assigned to interior walls. (Default: False).
        no_overwrite_: Boolean to note whether existing Surface boundary conditions should
            be preserved while solving adjacencies. If True, no intersection
            will occur and only newly-discovered adjacencies will be updated.
            If False or unspecified, all geometry will be cleaned and
            intersected before solving adjacencies. In either case, existing
            windows will be preserved.
            _
            Note that, to make use of this option effectively, Room2Ds must
            already have matching edge segments in order for them to be
            discovered as adjacent. The "DF Intersect Room2Ds" component
            can be used to ensure adjacent rooms have matching segments
            without changing any boundary conditions. (Default: False).
        _run: Set to True to run the component and solve adjacencies.

    Returns:
        report: Reports, errors, warnings, etc.
        df_objs: The input Dragonfly objects with adjacencies solved between the
            Room2D wall segments.
