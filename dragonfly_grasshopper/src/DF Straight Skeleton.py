"""
Get the straight skeleton of any horizontal planar geometry.
_
This is can also be used to generate core/perimeter sub-polygons if an offset is
input AND the straight skeleton is not self-intersecting. In the event of a
self-intersecting straight skeleton, the output line segments can still be used
to assist with the manual creation of core/perimeter offsets.
_
This component uses a modified version of the the polyskel package
(https://github.com/Botffy/polyskel) by Armin Scipiades (aka. @Bottfy),
which is, itself, a Python implementation of the straight skeleton
algorithm as described by Felkel and Obdrzalek in their 1998 conference paper
Straight skeleton implementation
(https://github.com/Botffy/polyskel/blob/master/doc/StraightSkeletonImplementation.pdf).

-

    Args:
        _floor_geo: Horizontal Rhino surfaces for which the straight skeleton
            will be computed.
        offset_: An optional positive number that will be used to offset the
            perimeter of the geometry to output core/perimeter polygons.
            If a value is plugged in here and the straight skeleton is not
            self-intersecting, perim_poly and core_poly will be ouput.

    Returns:
        polyskel: A list of line segments that represent the straight skeleton of
            the input _floor_geo. This will be output from the component no matter
            what the input _floor_geo is.
        perim_poly: A list of breps representing the perimeter polygons of the input
            _floor_geo. This will only be ouput if an offset_ is input and the
            straight skeleton is not self-intersecting.
        core_poly: A list of breps representing the core polygons of the input
            _floor_geo. This will only be ouput if an offset_ is input and the
            straight skeleton is not self-intersecting, and the offset is not
            so great as to eliminate the core.
