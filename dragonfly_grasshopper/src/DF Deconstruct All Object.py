"""
Deconstruct any Dragonfly geometry object into ALL of its constituent Dragonfly objects.
_
This is useful for editing auto-generated child objects separately from their parent.
For example, if you want to assign all of the ground floors of a given auto-generated
Building to have a Retail ProgramType, this can give you all of such Stories. Then
you can assign a Retail ProgramType to them and combine them with the other Stories
into a new Building.

    Args:
        _df_obj: A Dragonfly Building, Story or Room2D to be deconstructed into
            all of its constituent objects. Note that, Room2Ds do not have
            sub-objects assigned to them and the original object will be output.
    
    Returns:
        stories: All Story objects that make up the input _df_obj. This
            includes all Stories that make up input Buildings as well as any
            input orphaned Stories.
        room2ds: All Room2D objects that make up the input _df_obj. This
            includes any all Room2Ds assigned to input Stories or Buildings as
            well as any input orphaned Room2Ds.
