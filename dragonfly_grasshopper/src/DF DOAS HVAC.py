"""
Apply a Dedicated Outdoor Air System (DOAS) template HVAC to a list of Dragonfly
Buildings, Stories or Room2Ds.
_
DOAS systems separate minimum ventilation supply from the satisfaction of heating
+ cooling demand. Ventilation air tends to be supplied at neutral temperatures
(close to room air temperature) and heating / cooling loads are met with additional
pieces of zone equipment (eg. Fan Coil Units (FCUs)).
_
Because DOAS systems only have to cool down and re-heat the minimum ventilation air,
they tend to use less energy than all-air systems. They also tend to use less energy
to distribute heating + cooling by puping around hot/cold water or refrigerant
instead of blowing hot/cold air. However, they do not provide as good of control
over humidity and so they may not be appropriate for rooms with high latent loads
like auditoriums, kitchens, laundromats, etc.

    Args:
        _df_objs: Dragonfly Buildings, Stories or Room2Ds to which the input template
            HVAC will be assigned. If a list of Room2Ds is input, all objects
            will receive the same HVAC instance. Otherwise, each object gets its
            own instance (eg. each input Story will get its own HVAC). This can
            also be an etire dragonfly Model.
        _system_type: Text for the specific type of DOAS system and equipment.
            The "HB DOAS HVAC Templates" component has a full list of the
            supported DOAS system templates.
        _vintage_: Text for the vintage of the template system. This will be used
            to set efficiencies for various pieces of equipment within the system.
            The "HB Building Vintages" component has a full list of supported
            HVAC vintages. (Default: ASHRAE_2019).
        _name_: Text to set the name for the HVAC system and to be incorporated into
            unique HVAC identifier. If the name is not provided, a random name
            will be assigned.
        sensible_hr_: A number between 0 and 1 for the effectiveness of sensible
            heat recovery within the system. Typical values range from 0.5 for
            simple glycol loops to 0.81 for enthalpy wheels (the latter of
            which is a fairly common ECM for DOAS systems). (Default: 0).
        latent_hr_: A number between 0 and 1 for the effectiveness of latent heat
            recovery within the system. Typical values are 0 for all types of
            heat recovery except enthalpy wheels, which can have values as high
            as 0.76. (Default: 0).
        dcv_: Boolean to note whether demand controlled ventilation should be
            used on the system, which will vary the amount of ventilation air
            according to the occupancy schedule of the zone. (Default: False).
        doas_avail_sch_: An optional On/Off discrete schedule to set when the dedicated
            outdoor air system (DOAS) shuts off. This will not only prevent
            any outdoor air from flowing thorough the system but will also
            shut off the fans, which can result in more energy savings when
            spaces served by the DOAS are completely unoccupied. If None, the
            DOAS will be always on. (Default: None).

    Returns:
        df_objs: The input Dragonfly objects with a DOAS HVAC system applied.
