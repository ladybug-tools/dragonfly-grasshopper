"""
Get a validation report that contains a summary of all issues with the Model.
_
This includes basic properties like adjacency checks and all geometry checks.
Furthermore, extension attributes for Energy and Radiance can be checked
to ensure that the model can be simulated correctly in these engines.
-

    Args:
        _model: A Dragonfly Model object to be validated. This can also be the file path
            to a Model DFJSON that will be validated.
        extension_: Optional text for the name of the dragonfly extension for which
            validation will occur. The value input here is case-insensitive such
            that "radiance" and "Radiance" will both result in the model being
            checked for validity with dragonfly-radiance. This value can also be
            set to "Generic" in order to run checks for all installed extensions.
            Using "Generic" will run all except the most limiting of checks (like
            DOE2's lack of support for courtyards) with the goal of producing a
            model that is export-able to multiple engines (albeit with a little
            extra postprocessing for particularly limited engines). Some common
            dragonfly extension names that can be input here if they are installed
            include the following. (Default: Generic).
                * Radiance
                * EnergyPlus
                * OpenStudio
                * DOE2
        _validate: Set to "True" to validate the the Model and get a report of all
            issues with the model.

    Returns:
        report: A report summarizing any issues with the input _model. If anything is
            invalid about the input model, this component will give a warning
            and this report will contain information about the specific parts
            of the model that are invalid. Otherwise, this report will simply
            say that the input model is valid.
