"""
Get a validation report that contains a summary of all issues with the Model.
_
This includes checks for basic properties like adjacency as well as geometry checks.
-

    Args:
        _model: A Dragonfly Model object to be validated. This can also be the file path
            to a Model DFJSON that will be validated.
        _validate: Set to "True" to validate the the Model and get a report of all
            issues with the model.

    Returns:
        report: A report summarizing any issues with the input _model. If anything is
            invalid about the input model, this component will give a warning
            and this report will contain information about the specific parts
            of the model that are invalid. Otherwise, this report will simply
            say that the input model is valid.
