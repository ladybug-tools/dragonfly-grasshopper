"""
Create Dragonfly Buildings from footprint geometry (horizontal Rhino surfaces).
-

    Args:
        _footprint_geo: A list of horizontal Rhino surfaces to be converted
            into Buildings.
        _floor_to_floor: A list of float values with a length equal to the number of
            stories in each Building. Each value in the list represents the
            floor_to_floor height of the Story starting from the first floor and
            then moving to the top floor.
        perim_offset_: An optional positive number that will be used to offset
            the perimeter of the footprint to create core/perimeter Rooms.
            If this value is None or 0, no offset will occur and each floor
            plate will be represented with a single Room2D.
        _name_: Text to set the base name for the Building, which will also be
            incorporated into unique Building identifier. This will be combined
            with the index of each input _footprint_geo to yield a unique name
            for each output Building. If the name is not provided, a random one
            will be assigned.
        _program_: Text for the program of the Buildings (to be looked up in the
            ProgramType library) such as that output from the "HB List Programs"
            component. This can also be a custom ProgramType object. If no program
            is input here, the Buildings will have a generic office program.
        _constr_set_: Text for the construction set of the Buildings, which is used
            to assign all default energy constructions needed to create an energy
            model. Text should refer to a ConstructionSet within the library such
            as that output from the "HB List Construction Sets" component. This
            can also be a custom ConstructionSet object. If nothing is input here,
            the Buildings will have a generic construction set that is not sensitive
            to the Buildings's climate or building energy code.
        conditioned_: Boolean to note whether the Buildings have heating and cooling
            systems.
        _run: Set to True to run the component and create Dragonfly Buildings.

    Returns:
        report: Reports, errors, warnings, etc.
        buildings: Dragonfly buildings.
