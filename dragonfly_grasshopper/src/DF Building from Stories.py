"""
Create a Dragonfly Building from individual Dragonfly Story objects.
-

    Args:
        _stories: A list of Dragonfly Story objects to be joined into one Building.
        multipliers_: An optional list of integers with the same length as the
            input _stories, which will be used to override any existing multipliers
            on the input Story objects. This integer denotes the number of times
            that each Story is repeated over the height of the building. If
            nothing is input here, the multipliers on the existing Story objects
            will remain.
        _name_: Text to set the name for the Building, which will also be incorporated
            into unique Building identifier. If the name is not provided a random
            one will be assigned.
        _constr_set_: Text for the construction set of the Building, which is used
            to assign all default energy constructions needed to create an energy
            model. Text should refer to a ConstructionSet within the library such
            as that output from the "HB List Construction Sets" component. This
            can also be a custom ConstructionSet object. If nothing is input here,
            the Building will have a generic construction set that is not sensitive
            to the Buildings's climate or building energy code.

    Returns:
        report: Reports, errors, warnings, etc.
        building: Dragonfly Building.
