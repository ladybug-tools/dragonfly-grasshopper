"""
Get properties of any Dragonfly geometry object.
-

    Args:
        _df_objs: A Dragonfly Model, Building, Story or Room2D for which
            properties will be output.
    
    Returns:
        height: For a Model or a Building, this will be the average height of the
            object above the ground. For a Story, this will be the floor-to-floor
            height and, for a Room2D, this will be the floor-to-ceiling height.
        floor_area: A number for the floor area  of all Rooms in the dragonfly object.
        ext_wall_area: A number for the total area of walls in the dragonfly object
            with an Outdoors boundary condition.
        ext_win_area: A number for the total area of windows in the dragonfly object
            with an Outdoors boundary condition.
        volume: A number for the volume of all Rooms in the dragonfly object.
