"""
Load properties of the Ground Heat Exchangers (GHEs) from the "DF Write Modelica DES"
component. This includes the positions of boreholes in each GHE, the G-function
of each GHE that describes the response of the ground to load, an a range of other
properties output from the sizing simulation performed by GHEDesigner.
-

    Args:
        _sys_param: The system parameters JSON file output by the "DF Write Modelica DES"
            component. This includes the detailed Building load profiles,
            equipment specifications, and borehole field characteristics.
        _des_loop: The GHE Thermal Loop object output by the "DF GHE Thermal Loop",
            which contains the geometry of the district energy system.

    Returns:
        report: Reports, errors, warnings, etc.
        boreholes: A list of points for the borehole locations within the _site.
        borehole_geo: A list of line segments for each borehole in the ground
            heat exchanger, illustrating both the position and the demth of
            the borehole.
        g_function: A data tree of G-function coefficients that describe the response
            of the ground to the input loads. Each pair of factors represents
            a point on the G-function. Flattening this data tree enables you
            to plug it directly into the "Ironbug Ground Heat Exchanger Vertical"
            component to simulate the ground heat exchanger in EnergyPlus.
        properties: A list of properties for the GHE that can be used to describe it
            in EnergyPlus simulations. The properties that can be plugged directly
            into the parameters of the "Ironbug Ground Heat Exchanger Vertical"
            component. The properties are in the following order:
            _
            * Borehole Length
            * Borehole Radius
            * Design Flow Rate
            * Ground Temperature
            * Ground Conductivity
            * Ground Heat Capacity
            * Grout Conductivity
            * Number of Boreholes
            * Pipe Outer Diameter
            * Pipe Conductivity
            * Pipe Thickness
            * U Tube Distance
        month_temps: A list of ground temperatures in Celsius with one value for each month
            of the period over which the GHEDesigner simulation was run (typically
            20 years). This can be connected to a nativ Grasshopper "Quick Graph"
            component and used to check the drift in the ground temperature
            over long periods of time.
