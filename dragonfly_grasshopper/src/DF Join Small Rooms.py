"""
Join small Room2Ds together within Dragonfly Stories.
_
This is particularly useful after operations like automatic core/perimeter
offsetting, which can create several small Room2Ds from small segments in the
outline boundary around the Story.
-

    Args:
        _df_obj: A Dregonfly Story, Building or Model to have its small Room2Ds
            joined together across the model
        _area_thresh_: A number for the Room2D floor area below which it is considered
            a small room to be joined into adjacent rooms. (Default: 10.0 square meters).

    Returns:
        report: Reports, errors, warnings, etc.
        df_obj: The input Dragonfly objects with Room2Ds that have had small
            Room2Ds joined together.
