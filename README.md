# dragonfly-grasshopper

:dragon: :green_book: Dragonfly plugin for Grasshopper (aka. dragonfly[+]).

This repository contains all Grasshopper components for the dragonfly plugin.
The package includes both the userobjects (`.ghuser`) and the Python source (`.py`).
Note that this library only possesses the Grasshopper components and, in order to
run the plugin, the core libraries must be installed in a way that they can be
discovered by Rhino (see dependencies).
